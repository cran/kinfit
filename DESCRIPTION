Description: 
  The FOCUS Kinetics Report first published in 2006 describes mathematical
  models and recommends statistical methods for the evaluation of 
  chemical degradation data. This package implements fitting the kinetic
  models suitable for observations of the decline of a single chemical 
  compound (no metabolite formation/decline or multi-compartment kinetics).
  Please note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or
  fitness for a particular purpose.  'kinfit' is maintained, but not
  actively developed at the moment. Please check the 'mkin' package for an
  actively developed package for kinetic evaluations of degradation data.
