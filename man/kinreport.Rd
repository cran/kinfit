\title{
Creates a report of the kinetic fits
}
\description{
Function to create a report for a set of fitted models, passing it to the 
console as well as to a file, if specified.
}
\usage{
kinreport(kinobject, file = NA, data = TRUE, vcov = FALSE, endpoint.digits = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{kinobject}{
	A list containing the following elements:
	The name of the parent compound to be output (\code{parent}),
	the type of the test system (\code{type}), 
	the name of the specific test system used for generating this dataset
        (\code{system}), 
  the input dataset (\code{data}),
	the list of fitted kinetic models (\code{fits}), as returned by
        \code{\link{kinfit}}, and the list of results (\code{results}) 
        as returned by \code{\link{kinresults}}.
	Optionally also
	the label position of the test compound (\code{label}) and
	the source of the data (\code{source}). }
  \item{file}{ The name of the file to which to write. }
  \item{data}{ Boolean specifying if the input data should be printed? }
  \item{vcov}{ Should the variance-covariance matrix/matrices be reported? }
  \item{endpoint.digits}{ How many digits should be reported for DT50 and DT90 values? }
}
\value{
The function is called for its side effect, namely the report being passed
to the R console as well as to a text file if a filename is specified.
