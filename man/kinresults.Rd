\title{
Function to collect useful results for a set of fitted kinetic models
}
\description{
This function collects the parameters and some statistics for the fitted kinetic
models. It also generates DT50 and DT90 estimates.
}
\usage{
kinresults(kinfits, alpha = 0.05, DTmax = 1000, SFORB = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{kinfits}{
The list of kinetic model(s) for which to collect results. Usually this will
have been generated by \code{\link{kinfit}}.
}
  \item{alpha}{
The confidence level chosen for the chi-squared test used in the call to
\code{\link{kinerrmin}}.
}
  \item{DTmax}{
Upper end of the time interval that will be checked for the iterative determination
of DT50 and DT90 values for the FOMC and the DFOP model. If the DT50 or the
DT90 value is less than 0.1 different from \code{DTmax}, which will generally 
be the case if the optimization routine hits the upper end, the respective DT50 or
DT90 value will be reported as \code{NA}.
}
  \item{SFORB}{
Should the results of the \code{\link{DFOP}} model be presented as parameters
to the Single First-Order Reversible Binding (SFORB) model? }
}
\value{
A list containing a list of the parameters fitted by the models, a dataframe
containing some statistics for each of the fitted models, and a dataframe with
the resulting DT50 and DT90 values.
